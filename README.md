This repository contains the extensions for Matterport3D and Unreal Engine Assets.
The extensions should enable to easily load the assets into Isaac Sim, and have access to the semantic labels.
They are developed as part of the ViPlanner project ([Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00982) | [Code](https://github.com/leggedrobotics/viplanner))
and are based on the [Orbit](https://isaac-orbit.github.io/) framework.

**Attention:** 
The main part of the extensions is currently updated to the latest orbit version.
This repo contains a temporary solution that is sufficient for the demo script included in ViPlanner, found [here](https://github.com/leggedrobotics/viplanner/tree/main/omniverse).
An updated version will be available soon.


## Installation

To install the extensions, follow these steps:

1. Install Isaac Sim using the [Orbit installation guide](https://isaac-orbit.github.io/orbit/source/setup/installation.html).
2. Clone the orbit repo and link the extension.

```
git clone git@github.com:NVIDIA-Omniverse/orbit.git
cd orbit/source/extensions
ln -s {ORBIT_ENVS_PROJECT_DIR}/extensions/omni.isaac.matterport .
ln -s {ORBIT_ENVS_PROJECT_DIR}/extensions/omni.isaac.carla .
```

4. Then run the orbit installer script.

```
./orbit.sh -i -e
```

## Usage

For the matterport extensions, a GUI interface is available. To use it, start the simulation:

```
./orbit.sh -s
```

Then, in the GUI, go to `Window -> Extensions` and type in `Matterport` in the search bar. You should see the Matterport3D extension. 
Enable it to open the GUI.

To use both as part of an Orbit workflow, please refer to the [ViPlanner Demo](https://github.com/leggedrobotics/viplanner/tree/main/omniverse).
